## User Guide tab (does not exist yet — needs to be built)
Add a "User Guide" tab to the UI (alongside the main upload form). Content to include:

### If your file is over 1 GB
Preferred: split the recording into segments.
  - Recommended tool: Audacity (free) — File > Export > Export Multiple, split by time
  - Command-line option: `ffmpeg -i interview.wav -f segment -segment_time 1800 -c copy part%03d.wav`
    (splits into 30-minute chunks; adjust segment_time as needed)
  - Run each segment through VxH separately, then combine the output CSV files.

Also works: compress to a smaller format before uploading.
  - MP3 (320 kbps): good quality, ~1/5 the size of WAV
  - FLAC: lossless compression, ~1/2 the size of WAV
  - `ffmpeg -i interview.wav -b:a 320k interview.mp3`
  - VxH accepts .wav, .mp3, .flac, and other common formats.

### If VxH is taking too long
Processing time scales with recording length. Without a GPU, Whisper transcription
alone takes roughly 1× real-time (a 60-minute interview takes ~60 minutes).

Options:
  - Split the recording (see above) and run segments in parallel on separate machines.
  - Use a smaller Whisper model (e.g., "small" or "base") — faster but less accurate.
  - Run VxH locally via the command line (`python main.py`), which avoids upload time
    and lets you run on your own hardware with a GPU.
  - Contact the lab for access to a GPU-equipped server if you have many recordings.
